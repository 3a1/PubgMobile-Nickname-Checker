# Pubg Mobile Nickname Taken Checker

Working on pixel recognition in "add button".
Only for emulator.

# Usage
To work, you need to replace the location of the pixel of this button with your own.
I also advise replacing the pixel recognition system with image recognition, then it will be possible to run the program at any screen resolution without the need to change the location of the button.

# Speed
Depends on your PC and processing method, also depends on the length of nicknames that you will check.

Average of 5,000 to 10,000 nicknames per 24 hours.
